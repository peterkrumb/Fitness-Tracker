# Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

## Purpose
This app is designed to allow the user to input data about their workout and track their workouts. The frontend was fully designed for us, so we had to develop the html and api routes. The html routes are a simple res.sendFile which displays the html files when the route is hit. The apiroutes contained different routes which either retireved or posted information to the database.
